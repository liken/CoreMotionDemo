CoreMotionDemo
==============

Use MotionManager to motitor device orientation.

To use the demo, you just need to implement the delegate,and use the
delegate function to monitor device orientation.Donâ€™t need to worry
about the device lock.

You can just use it as below:
//define the monitor
var motionMonitor:MotionSynchronizer

//in viewdidload
motionMonitor = MotionSynchronizer()
motionMonitor.delegate = self

// start monitor
motionMonitor.startMonitorMotion()

// End monitor
motionMonitor.stopMonitorMotion()
